Social Network Location Disambiguation 
The purpose of this project is to propose, implement and evaluate a novel approach to au- tomatically disambiguate and 
infer the location of social network users. Given a user u who discloses no location or an ambiguous toponym, the idea 
is to infer/disambiguate her true location by using:

• Theactivitiesofu,suchasthetextthatshewritesandthephotosthatshepublishes
• Theactivitiesofthefriendsofuand/orthelocationdisclosedbythem.

The content generated by u can give some clues as to her true location; for instance, she may frequently mention named 
entities (e.g., politician names) that relate to a particular country. Also, the textual content (and the photos, 
for that matters) may be accompanied by geotags. Depending on the network, the determination of the friends of u
may be difficult. In some networks, such as Facebook, a link between two users often represents a friendship 
relation- ship because both have to agree on the establishment of the link. In other networks, such as Twitter, 
a link between two users can be established even without the explicit consent of one of them. In these networks, 
a friendship relationship must be determined by looking, for instance, at bidirectional links, or implicit links 
(the ones representing the interactions between users).
